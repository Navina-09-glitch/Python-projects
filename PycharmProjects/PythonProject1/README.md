# Python Concept Programs

This repository contains Python programs demonstrating fundamental concepts. All programs are designed to read data dynamically from the keyboard and illustrate how Python works step by step.

Operators and Expressions in Python
Arithmetic Operators → +, -, *, /, %

Assignment Operators → =, +=, -=, *=, /=

Relational Operators → ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=

Logical Operators → and, or, not

Bitwise Operators → &, |, ^, <<, >>

Identity Operators → is, is not

Ternary Operators → Conditional expressions (x if condition else y)

Loops
for_loop_example.py → Demonstrates iteration using a for loop

while_loop_example.py → Demonstrates iteration using a while loop

If-Else
ifelse_example.py → Basic conditional statements

nested_if_example.py → Nested conditions for complex decision making

Transfer Flow Statements
break_example.py → Exits a loop prematurely

continue_example.py → Skips the current iteration and continues with the next

Nested Loops
for_in_for.py → for loop inside another for loop

while_in_while.py → while loop inside another while loop

for_in_while.py → for loop inside a while loop

while_in_for.py → while loop inside a for loop

Function Approaches
Approach 1

Input: Taken from function call

Process: Inside function body

Output: Returned to function call

Approach 2

Input: Taken inside function body

Process: Done inside function body

Output: Produced inside function body

Approach 3

Input: Taken from function call

Process: Inside function body

Output: Produced inside function body

Approach 4

Input: Taken inside function body

Process: Inside function body

Output: Returned to function call

Modules
programmer_defined_modules.py → Creating and importing custom modules

reuse_modules.py → Reusing built-in and custom modules

Exception Handling
try_except_example.py → Handling runtime errors gracefully

try_except_finally.py → Using finally to ensure cleanup actions

multiple_exceptions.py → Catching different types of exceptions

raise_exception.py → Raising custom exceptions

File Operations
file_read_example.py → Reading data from files

file_write_example.py → Writing data to files

file_append_example.py → Appending data to existing files

file_seek_tell.py → Demonstrating random access with seek() and tell()

file_with_context.py → Using with statement for safe file handling
